# Greenhouse Wiki Template

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This is a modified version of the starlight astro template. It contains various useful components for a wiki (mainly a minecraft style wiki, but can be used for any wiki).

Contains components like infobox, and tool icons.

Future plans are recipe components that display various minecraft recipes.

## Usage
Usage is the same as the starlight astro template. Check the [starlight astro documentation](https://starlight.astro.build) for more information.


## Note
The components in this template will eventually just be turned into a NPM package that can be installed uses in any astro project. This repo will just act as a template that has the package installed, with pages that show how to use all the components.
